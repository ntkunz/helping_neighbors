When a user signs up they are preseneted all other users within a 1/2 kilometer of their address with the option to message them. More connected communities are safer and happier than isolated ones and working together can help create a sense of purpose. I think that helping people to connect in the real world may be one of the healthiest uses of technology at this point.

The site is functional and you are safe to create an account and have a look around (you may also delete your account in the edit profile section). There are many things I'd like to implement before calling it complete including adding 2-factor authentication, password reset, more user customization, a 'new message' alert, and plenty of ui updates. I also have some re-factoring to do for performance and clarity as this is a work in progress. If there is anything that you'd like to off up as a suggestion for improving the site it would be well received.

The repository for the Node/Express server is [here](https://github.com/ntkunz/hn_db).
